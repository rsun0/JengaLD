# JengaLD

JengaLD is our jacked up take on the classic family game, Jenga. JengaLD allows players to play giant games of Jenga against other players on separate computers. In addition, our implementation of the Leap Motion hand sensor allows players to reach out and grasp the Jenga blocks as if the blocks were really in front of them. If that wasn't enticing enough, the immaculate graphics and physics engine Unreal Engine 4 provided us, allowed us to provide you guys with an even more realistic experience.
